# Force-platform-project

When you exercise, it is difficult for your body to be in equilibrium. There is a force platform, which is a product for displaying specific figures, but it is difficult to have a gym, or an individual because it is expensive. This project aims to make a cheap version of the force platform system yourself.

The following technologies will be used for this project:

- Flutter
- Embedded System
- Firmware
- DSP (Digital Signal Processing)
- ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)
- Bluetooth (BLE)

The following devices will be required:

- Android tablet
- ESP32 development board
- Two load cells
- ADS1220 ADC module
